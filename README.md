# Biomolecular Model Systems 
This repo stores PDB files of biomolecular systems. 
You can use these files to validate your MD simulation set up.

- Chignolin
  - `1uao_chignolin.pdb`: 1st model in 1uao
  - `chignolin_flat.pdb`: capped chignolin
  - `2rvd_fixer_capped.pdb`: CLN025. Capped PDB after performing pdbfixer
- Trypcage 
  - `1l2y_model1_trypcage.pdb`: 1st model in 1l2y
  - `trypcage_flat.pdb`: flat conformation
- Calmodulin
  - `1cll_calmodulin_capped.pdb`: capped conformation of 1cll.
- Bcl-xL
  - `1maz_capped.pdb`: capped conformation of 1maz.
  - `1maz_capped_F143W.pdb`: capped conformation of 1maz mutated by F143W
  - `1maz_capped_F143L.pdb`: capped conformation of 1maz mutated by F143L
- AAQAA_3
  - `AAQAA_3/AAQAA_3_flat.pdb`: flat conformation
  - `AAQAA_3_helix.pdb`: alhpa-helical conformation
  - `AAQAA_3/AAQAA_3_random.pdb`: extended conformation (made by PyMOL sculpting).
